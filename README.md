# Deprecation notice
New Nova 4 release is fully responsive (https://nova.laravel.com/docs/4.0/releases.html#responsive-design), so this package is no longer needed and it will not be updated anymore.

Thanks to everybody for the support during this years and I hope the package was useful to many people.

If you are using and old (<= 3) version of Nova, you still can use this package, but there will be no more releases or bug fixes.
